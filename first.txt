this is version 1 of my project

I want this to go into commit

1. git init: only use for the first time only, if you run this command again it will reinitilize the repositary, which we don not want.
2. git add --a : all the changes will get staged. (committed)
3. git add first.txt: add only the file which you want is good. Do not add the files you are not sure of will work fine.
4. git status: to look at the status of the repository, track changes etc.
5. git log: see the changes time by person etc. all info.
6. git commmit -m "xxxx yyyyy" : see the commits and messages put

Finally use git log to see the final stages.
