I want this to go into commit

1. git init: only use for the first time only, if you run this command again it will reinitilize the repositary, which we don not want.
2. git add --a : all the changes will get staged. (committed)
3. git add first.txt: add only the file which you want is good. Do not add the files you are not sure of will work fine.
4. git status: to look at the status of the repository, track changes etc.
5. git log: see the changes time by person etc. all info.
6. git commmit -m "xxxx yyyyy" : see the commits and messages put (eg: bugs fixed etc)
7. rm -rf .git : Deletes the git content of the repository. No tracking of the repo from now. 
8. git diff: compares modified files with that of the staging area
9. git add -a -m "Direct commit": skips the staging part and commits directly, untrakcked files cannot be commited directly, we need to add that file first and then commit changes
10. git checkout -- first_rename.txt: rolls back to the previously committed file. Problematic if you have an information in the latest file and you did not commit that. Be careful!
11. git checkout -f: same as previous, but for all the files. Again, be very careful!
12. (i) git remote xx yy (take from github- from an existing repository, eg git remote add origin https://github.com/Abhinna-Sundar/git-learn.git): create a website where this repository exists.
    (ii) git remote (after you use the previous command): to see the remotes -- in this case it is origin
    (iii)git remote -v: see how to push and fetch the commits and files from repository

Finally use git log to see the final stages.
